# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This is my (unfinished!!!) attempt at creating an online version of the legendary "Wizard Book" by Abelsen, Sussman & Sussman, complete with executable, editable code examples (as inspired by [Backbone + Coffee](http://www.scriptybooks.com/books/backbone-coffeescript)... another masterpiece).

For anyone who hasn't heard of SICP, here's what Peter Norvig has to say about it:

> To use an analogy, if SICP were about automobiles, it would be for the person who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient, safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century ... Those who hate SICP think it doesn't deliver enough tips and tricks for the amount of time it takes to read. But if you're like me, you're not looking for one more trick, rather you're looking for a way of synthesizing what you already know, and building a rich framework onto which you can add new learning over a career. That's what SICP has done for me. I read a draft version of the book around 1982, when I was in grad school, and it changed the way I think about my profession. If you're a thoughtful computer scientist (or want to be one), it will change your life too.


Basically, after discovering the aforementioned [Backbone + Coffee](http://www.scriptybooks.com/books/backbone-coffeescript), I decided that all programming books should be interactive and love it or hate it, SICP is such an important book I kinda feel like it needs to exist in this form... plus what better way could there be of having that enlightenment experience of truly groking the power of Lisp for the first time than reading this book with a scheme interpreter built right in :)

For those who are interested, the editors execute your code using [BiwaScheme](http://www.biwascheme.org/)

## NOTE: This is not only unfinished... THERE IS NO CONTENT YET!!!
TODO:
- scrape the book from the website and compile it to data
- add the data import functionality
- enable vim keybindings
- put some kind of layout around the content
- enable bookmarking using html5 local storage
- smart-phone-ify it
